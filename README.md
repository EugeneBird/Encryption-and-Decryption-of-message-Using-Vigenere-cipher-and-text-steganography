# Encryption-and-Decryption-of-message-Using-Vigenere-cipher-and-text-steganography
To run this code make sure you paste the files where your IDE has permission to read and write the files.
(In most systems pasting the code in documents would work)

ENCRYPTION
1) "cyber_test_final.txt" has the cover text. (You can modify the text as you like just make sure that the no. of lines in the 
    cover text should be more than 8 times the length of your message. (No.of lines in cover = 8*length of message) )
2) "cyber_test_output_final.txt" will have your stego text. (Hidden encrypted message)

DECRYPTION
1) "cyber_test_output_final.txt" will have your stego text. (Hidden encrypted message)
2) "cyber_test_decrypted_final.txt" will contain your decrypted message.

The Encryption used is Vigenere cipher
The Steganography used is text steganography in which we change the first letter of each line to required letter case(Upper or Lower case)
according to the bits of each character of the encrypted message.
